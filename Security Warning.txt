Important Security Information

Protecting Your Data

Security is a top priority in this project. Here's what you need to know:

1. Barcode Security:
The barcode image is a crucial security asset. Please ensure it is stored in a secure folder. If possible, restrict access to trusted users only. This barcode can generate important codes, so handle it with care.

2. Safeguarding Secrets:
Sensitive information, such as passwords, is stored in the app.config file. Exercise caution when handling it. Do not share it widely, and ensure that only authorized individuals have access. This precaution is essential to maintain the security of your information during testing.

3. Code Security:
I am proud to report that my code is designed to be 99% secure. I have addressed most vulnerabilities by using access modifiers to control who can view and modify sensitive parts of the code. However, it's important to acknowledge that potential vulnerabilities may exist related to stored secrets and file path visibility. I am actively working to address these concerns as part of my ongoing commitment to your security.
